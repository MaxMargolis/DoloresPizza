# DoloresPizza
This is a demo project to practice request chaining (see DataFetcher.swift) with Combine in the context of a generic protocol based network layer.
Uses Foursquare API to find and display top 10 recommended pizza places near Dolores Park in San Francisco.

Don't forget to set your own Foursquare API keys in ApiKeys.swift!
